## The FreeTxt app

Here is the [link to FreeTxt app](https://www.freetxt.app/) which is currently under development. 

- FreeTxt was developed as part of an AHRC funded collaborative FreeTxt supporting bilingual free-text survey and questionnaire data analysis research project involving colleagues from Cardiff University and Lancaster University (Grant Number AH/W004844/1).

- The team included PI - Dawn Knight; CIs - Paul Rayson, Mo El-Haj; RAs - Ignatius Ezeani, Nouran Khallaf and Steve Morris. The Project Advisory Group included representatives from: National Trust Wales, Cadw, Museum Wales, CBAC | WJEC and National Centre for Learning Welsh.

## Summariser.py

The run_summarizer function is designed to provide a concise summary of a given text using the TextRank algorithm. This function is versatile, as it can accept both strings and iterable objects as input. If the input is not a string, the function converts it into one. The core of this function lies in its ability to adjust the length of the summary based on the chosen_ratio parameter, which dictates the proportion of the original text to be included in the summary.

### Key Features:
Input Flexibility: Handles both string and iterable inputs, seamlessly converting iterables into a string format.
Customizable Summary Length: Allows the user to specify the summary length through the chosen_ratio parameter, with a minimum threshold set at 0.1.
Language Support: Primarily supports English (default) but can be adapted for other languages.
