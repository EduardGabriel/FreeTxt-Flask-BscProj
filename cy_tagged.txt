i feel it is very clear that we want to ensure a place where all feel safe and a sense of belonging 
yes it does communicate our overall ambition for within the university but maybe undersells our ability to influence other organisations we work with by the stance we take and the standards we set 
it has both depth and breath in edi and is constructive in tone
as any strategic plan it is necessarily high level but it has the components needed the focus on welshness is welcomed as part of what makes cardiff distinctive it is generally readable and not too long though there is some repetition eg several mentions of the inclusive education project
the document promotes a ambition to make a welcoming community within the university and trust and positive impact in the wider community  it is very cardiff focused
the strategy is hardly ambitious enough it does not show a real commitment to tackling inequalities which require progressive and proactive actions 
it says a lot of good things but there doesnt seem to be much detail on how it is going to be achieved could you say some of the things already done and expand on them to make it clear what is in place and how staff and could get involved rather than it being a top down approach 
promote equal opportunities for everyone in our community to engage with 
 cannot work when nepotism is in place throughout the university this eliminates minorities entering the organisation

reviewing our recruitment practices to increase representation in our professional services teams of black asian and minority ethnic people  ensuring this staff body is representative of the working population of cardiff 
 a lot of stigma attached recruiting minorities all staff must complete mandatory training to train them to eliminate bias a lot of micro level behaviours go missed that need attentionaction  collusive behaviours need to be tackled and firm punishments in place for staff acting unfairly

reviewing our recruitment practices to ensure we are perceived by potential candidates as an inclusive welcoming and supportive employer
 this can only achieved when the roles minorities are employed to are not just in edi based roles but are in other areas such as finance marketing teaching admin hr  across all boards and in more senior positions 

the document is called a strategic plan without any clear strategy or plan there is an entire page devoted to cynefin but this is just marketing what are the issues in the university that you are trying to address we have pay gaps and inequality in staff contracts resulting in staff strikes since the last plan the medical school has been accused of institutional racism you need to directly address these issues the current document is just pr waffle
use of strong language to demonstrate our determination is well presented 
very much like the use of cynefin as a starting point  points at least theoretically to an objective that is holistic in nature and by using a welsh term shows a starting commitment to embed welsh culture in more than a superficial way
clearly laid out with objectives
the strategy is largely clear with specific actions and i only know what your overall ambition is and what you want to achieve through reading the document so i am unable to identify any gaps   
all covered but not very detailed
the proposal is ambitious but with every ambitious proposal the test is whether it will be delivered or will remain only on paper however it was delightful to see such a rigorously written and comprehensive document which in my mind would completely transform cardiff university to a pioneer institution in best edi practice
although it is aspirational it is too generic there are not enough identifiable or smart specifics there is no sense that this is building on the past plans to deal with the present with an eye to the future there is a yawning gap around leadership from not only the top but throughout the organisation the plan needs to be organic to be allowed to evolve to achieve what is required will require more that a 4 year plan it requires more like a ten year plan that would willingly carry people along with the organisation
overall we feel that the strategy is clear and comprehensive and sets out an ambition for edi that our school can get behind we particularly like the idea of using cynefin as a concept and are adopting this when considering our own attempts to decolonise our building and curriculum and provide a safe and inclusive environment in socsi

we think there is some room for improvement as specified in other responses
you have thought of everything as where i worked last they had nothing and did nothing since i have been working for cardiff university i have been shocked and surprised how supportive they have been
three main objectives clearly defined with both the why and the how
lots of generic statements and one mention if protected characteristics new buildings are often less suitable for people with neuro diverse characteristics and those with hidden disabilities
1	i think the idea of cynefin is fantastic may be some details on how to pronounce the word for those of us who do not speak welsh
a more explicit commitment to inclusion and support of trans staff and students is needed
there are no kpis or ways to actually measure what you are proposing risking the strategy plan to be seen as purely tokenistic by those reading even if it is supposed to be highlevel there are only two instances of disability equality being mentioned and only one of sexuality supporting pride mentioned this is very low for a document that says it aims to tackle issues around these minorities 
overall we welcome the strategic equality plan as a positive step however the plan lacks explicit mention of trans people ie transgender gender nonconforming and nonbinary people this omission contributes to the overwhelming feeling that cardiff university does not recognise that the increasingly hostile context for trans people in the uk and worldwide is one of ‘the most pertinent issues facing our community’ strategic equality plan p 1  

there are specific forms of marginalisation oppression and discrimination that trans people face in our university community and beyond therefore we would welcome more detailed meaningful forward planning to tackle the issues that trans people face and a clearer demonstration that supporting equality for trans staff and students is a priority examples of specific measures to address our unique challenges include support with respect for pronouns gender status change administration on student and staff systems and provision of genderneutral facilities 

an explicit statement on trans staff and students would align with the lgbtq action plan for wales 2023 in which the welsh government commits to working with universities in wales to ‘ensure their strategic equality plans sep set out how they will meet their duties under the equality act 2010 including as this relates to gender reassignment and sexual orientation’ welsh government 2023 p 50 
thank you for working on this i really do appreciate taking the effort on building on this although i am no expert in equality topic maybe a good idea might be in future editions could be what are the problems faced by the people in this area and then provide cardiff university response to that that would help people to relate the document to their life right now i know that theres a plan but until people are fully aware of the problems it doesnt help a lot
the strategy outlines a set of broad targets and objectives which would be virtually impossible to measure in terms of concrete achievements
i agree that it communicates an ambition but i believe that the ambition could be more clearly aligned with tackling inequalities please see the response i have submitted by email for more detail
proposed objectives are clear including the subobjectives
the language used is too highlevel and inaccessible much of the strategy is also written that looks to review rather than improve except in antiracism where there is a commendable focus but not a strong enough commitment to support and root out existing pockets of racist behaviour and practice i know of colleagues in the university who want to see comprehensive nongrievance pathways to raise concerns around racism how can you raise a complaint around racism if youre the only nonwhite member of a team without making your experience worse
